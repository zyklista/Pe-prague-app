4. Deploy!

### 3. GitHub Pages

Free hosting directly from your GitHub repository.

#### Setup

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

Create `.env` file (never commit this):
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
VITE_APP_ENV=production
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Build Optimization

For production builds, consider:
- Code splitting for larger chunks
- Image optimization
- Service worker for offline support
- Analytics integration

## üîí Security Considerations

### HTTPS Required
Voice features require HTTPS. All recommended platforms provide SSL certificates.

### Content Security Policy
Add CSP headers for enhanced security:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com; font-src fonts.gstatic.com;
```

### Environment Variables
- Never commit API keys to git
- Use platform-specific environment variable systems
- Rotate keys regularly in production

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Before Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` to check bundle size
2. Optimize images in `public` folder
3. Enable gzip compression on hosting platform
4. Configure caching headers

### After Deployment
- Test on multiple devices and browsers
- Check Core Web Vitals
- Monitor performance with analytics
- Test voice features on HTTPS
